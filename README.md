# Pns
In this course, we were tasked to do our 1D project on mutlivariate distirbution. Our group came up with the following problem.

## Find the correlation between Time spent on MRT, Time spent on Bus and total distance travelled

We came up with the following random variables.
- X-  Time taken on bus ride (Travelling time)
- Y- Total distance travelled (On commute, for one journey)
- Z- Time taken on MRT ride (Travelling time)

We found that our correlations in general did not show a strong correlation.
